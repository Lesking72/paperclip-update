# paperclip-update
 Updater script for the Paper Minecraft Server

## Usage
 This is only for in-place upgrading `paperclip.jar`. It won't do a fresh install or back up your world or anything special.  
 Edit line 21 to change the targeted Minecraft version. It's currently set for 1.16.3.  
 It uses `version_history.json` to determine the currently installed version. `version_history.json` is updated by Paper, so the tool will still believe an update is available if you haven't run the server after updating.
